# AI_CONTEXT.md

## Workflow
- Keep TODO.md synchronized (mark complete, add new tasks)
- Avoid absolute paths in code and configuration files
- Do not add AI attribution to commit messages (no "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" footers)
- Keep commit messages concise - use bullet points for changes, avoid verbose explanations
- Never push commits to git without explicit user confirmation
